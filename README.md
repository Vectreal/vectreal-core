# Vectreal Core

Vectreal Core is a robust, community-driven, open-source toolkit designed to seamlessly integrate high-performance 3D content into React-based projects. Our mission is to empower developers, designers, and creators with comprehensive resources to build stunning, interactive 3D experiences.

The monorepo is orchestrated using NX within an npm workspaces environment, primarily consisting of React.js projects.

> This project provides easy-to-use, fully configured components, hooks, and additional tools built on top of [Three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js) and [React Three Fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber).

## Packages

### React Packages

- **[@vctrl/hooks](https://github.com/Vectreal/vectreal-core/tree/main/packages/hooks)**: A collection of useful React hooks for loading and interacting with 3D files.

  - **use-load-model**: File or directory loading hooks for various approaches (Event based, React Context, direct)

  - **use-optimize-model**: Utilizing the [gltf-transform](https://gltf-transform.dev/) js library to optimize models in the browser. May be used standaloe or in conjunction with the `use-load-model` hook for convenience.

  - **use-export-model**: Export the scene in multiple formats using a minimal API

- **[@vctrl/viewer](https://github.com/Vectreal/vectreal-core/tree/main/packages/viewer)**: A fully type-safe and ready-to-use viewer component for React.

  Built with the `@vctrl/hooks/use-load-model` hook to dynamically load various model file types.

  Supported file formats:

  - glTF (with .bin and textures)
  - GLB
  - OBJ
  - USDZ (limited support, work in progress)

### Docker

- **[Docker images](https://github.com/Vectreal/vectreal-core/tree/main/packages/docker)**: (Work in Progress) Easily deploy convenient Vectreal tools like file converters in your Docker environment.

## Applications

- **[Official Website](https://github.com/Vectreal/vectreal-core/tree/main/apps/official-website)**: A showcase application built using the components and software provided in this monorepo. Deployed using GitHub Actions and Google Cloud.
